Installing physicsnemo specially physicsnemo.sym is very complicated for the the windows
Best is to use the docker container
  To install docer links are
  Generice webpage: https://github.com/openhackathons-org/End-to-End-AI-for-Science/blob/main/Deployment_Guide.MD
  Docker installation: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html


Along with docker you will also need wsl on windows laptop, install it. Its a linux environment in windows mahchine

Once Docker and wsl are installed, it can be started with below commands
    To start the Jupyter Lab Session
      1) Open CMD in admin mode
      2) Go to linux with type 'wsl'
      3) cd to 'C:\Users\Prasanna\Documents\python_projects\NVDIA_PhysicsNeMo_end_to_end_ai_for_science'
      4) Start docker with 'sudo docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864  -p 8888:8888 -p 8889:8889 -it --rm openhackathons:ai-for-science'
      5) Open the jupyter notebook
      6) Copy the code that you want to run, you can also create subdirectories
      7) open terminal and cd to appropriate directory, start with cd python
      8) run the file by command python 'filename'. Note if config.yaml is used it must be placed in folder conf
      9) note, any changes are not automatically saved and will be lost once the jupyter notebook is closed
      10) the output files like .vtk, .vtp, or .npz., can be visualized in paraview
